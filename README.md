# Samplify

## Motivation

Have you ever heard one of your favourite songs and noticed a short snippet of a song that you recognised, but couldn't quite put your finger on what it was? This is where Samplify comes in. Samplify allows you to search for any recognised song and find samples of other songs that were used by the producer with playable YouTube links.

## How do I use Samplify?

To get started, simply click on the search bar and start to search for your favourite song by pressing 'Enter'. You then need to click on the artwork of that song to see the results.

No sample found? Sadly, not all songs make use of samples, but you should instead be presented with a preview of that song via Apple Music.

Here's a song you can test that includes 3 samples:
**Pound Cake by Drake**
